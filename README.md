# UI-assignment
To develop this project I have used front end Technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript, I have designed a responsive website where the user can run this app in any device.
Firstly, i have created simple HTML(hyper text markup language) page by including connect keplr button in login card as mention in the task after that i have given a link for the installation of the keplr extension and documnentation respectively.
after creating html code i have added styling using CSS(cascading stylish sheet) i have designed a responsive website using media queries.
to make interacitve i have added js code by writing all the functionaliteis that are required to run as mentioned in the task.
you can find documentation here https://docs.keplr.app/ and you can find extension url as well here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap.
first create keplr account and place that account address in the js code to get access for the NFTs
and create another account to test switching.
entire website will be in the same page, can navigate back using back button.
